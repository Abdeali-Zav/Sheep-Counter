# Sheep-Counter
Sheep counter made with 2 pir sensors.  
Two pir sensors are kept at a distance of 30 cm apart one after the another.  
When the sheep comes inside the fence the 2pir sensors will detect motion with pir1 sensing first then pir2 and the count will be increased by 1  
Similarly if the sheep goes out, pir 2 will sense first followed by pir1 and the count will be decreased by 1.
